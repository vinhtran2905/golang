Arrays are the building blocks for both slices and maps
Slices are the idiomatic way in Go you work with collections of data. 
Maps are the way you work with key/value paris of data.
The built-in function make allow you to create slices and maps with initial length and capacity. 
Slice and map literals can be used as well and support seting intial values for use.
Slices have a capacity restriction but can be extended using the builtin function append
Maps dont have a capacity or any restriction on growth
The built-in function len can be used to retrieve the length of a slice or map
The built-in function cap only works on slices
Through the use of composition you can create multidimensional arrays and slices.
You can also create maps with values that are slices and other maps. A slice cannot be used as a map key
Passing a slice or map to a function is cheap and odesnot make a copy of the underlying data structure
