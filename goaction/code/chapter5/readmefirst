Chapter 5: Go's type system
Go is a statically typed programming languauge which is the compiler always wants to know what the type is for every value in the program.
When the compiler knows the type information ahead of time, it can help to make sure that the program is working with values in a safe way. 
This helps to reduce potential memory corruption and bugs and probvides the compiler the opportunity to produce more performant code
